    question: 'How does web.dev/measure differ from PageSpeed Insights?',
    answer:
      'web.dev/measure measures the overall quality of a web page in a lab environment (using Lighthouse). It gives insights about multiple quality categories from Lighthouse, including Performance, Accessibility and SEO. PageSpeed Insights (PSI) is performance focused, using both lab (Lighthouse) and field (Chrome UX Report) data to provide a summary of performance. Furthermore, PSI provides origin level insights in the field, whereas web.dev/measure is intended to deep-dive into a single URL in the lab.',
